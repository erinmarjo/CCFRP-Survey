### Summary of changes made in excel

**Please see information script for a full list of changes**

* Changes for question about first year of volunteering:
  
  * if there was a question mark, question mark was removed
  
  * if angler started volunteering 'the first year', institution was checked. If CP or MLML was the main institution the angler volunteers with 'the first year' = 2007. If SIO, UCSB, BML, HSU was the main institutuion, 'the first year' = 2017.
  
  * if the language referred to the number of years volunteered, the year was put as 2021-the anglers response. example '8 years ago' would be 2021-8 = 2013
  
  * If range of years, the most conservative year was used except if the year was not within the study period (2007-2021)
  

* Changes for interconnectedness with nature question:
  
  * Explanation of number erased
  
  * If range of numbers (only one case), the most conservative number was used

# Preliminary Figures for Snapshot Analysis

All graphs are set up the same way - Standard ggplot grey color, larger font size etc. These are the graphs that made it into the google doc/snapshot analysis.

**FONT SIZE**

To change the size of the percentages above bars, change the `size` argument in `geom_text()`. To change the size of the axis title or text, change the `size` argument inside of the `theme()` function --this should be the last function on the end of each ggplot.

**PLOT COLOR**

-For bars that are all one color: include a `fill` and `color` argument inside of `geom_col()`, but OUTSIDE of the aestheic function `aes()`. Assign a fill and color using hexidecimal ggplot colors. Examples are '#000666', #CC6600' which have to be in quotes. You can find all the colors here: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/. 

-For bars that are different colors, assign the colors manually. Add a `fill` and `color` argument INSIDE of `aes()` inside of `geom_col()`. Then add two more functions to ggplot: `scale_fill_manual()` and `scale_color_manual()` with the designated colors inside.

**ORIENTATION**

To turn the bars horizonally, add the function `coord_flip()` to ggplot

# In-Depth Plots and Analyses

**GOALS/LAB MEETING NOTES (2021-09)**:

* Should we break down some of these by demographic information?

  * Education level would be interesting
  
  * Interconnectedness with nature (not really demographic, but still interesting)

* Breakdown by institution... or is that going to be biased because CP and MLML have been running CCFRP for longer? Maybe table this until speaking w the group again.

* Breakdown by length of volunteer time? Easy enough, subtract year column from 2021 and use those numbers as categories. Should each year be a category, or should we bin by number of years volunteered? `1-2`, `3-4`, `5-6`, `7-8`, `9-10`, `>10`?

* Alternative ways to visualize the data

## Data Prep for Vis

```{r data prep}

survey_dat_an <- survey_dat_clean %>%
  select(q1:unanswered)
  

```


## Length of Time Volunteered

The potential hypothesis here being that the longer an angler has volunteered with CCFRP, the more their opinions will have shifted to the 'positive' side of viewing the creation of MPAs (questions 9 & 11), the higher their opinion of the management of California's groundfish stocks (question 23). Potentially that volunteers who have been with CCFRP for many years will also think that fishes are more abundant, diverse, and larger within MPAs than outside of them (the 'skip' code in question 15 in Qualtrics should take care of those who had never fished in an MPA... otherwise this would be a caveat to consider).

### VISUALS

Breaking up some of the questions regarding feelings towards MPAs and conservaion mindedness based on the length of time that anglers have volunteered with CCFRP.

```{r}

time_vol_dat <- survey_dat_an %>%
  mutate(time_vol = 2021-q1 + 1) %>%
  select(q1, q9:q12, q16, q17, q18, q26, time_vol) %>%
  drop_na(time_vol, q11) %>%
  filter(q1 %in% c(2007:2021)) %>%
  mutate(time_cat = case_when(
    time_vol %in% c(1:2) ~ "1-2 years",
    time_vol %in% c(3:4) ~ "3-4 years",
    time_vol %in% c(5:6) ~ "5-6 years",
    time_vol %in% c(7:8) ~ "7-8 years",
    time_vol %in% c(9:10) ~ "9-10 years",
    time_vol > 10 ~ ">10 years",
  ))
## 5 rows of data did not have a year recorded for question 1
## 1 row did not have any 'after' information so the data would not be paired
## 3 rows not in CCFRP time frame based on angler answer (1999, 2005, 2006)


## code to check NA in data
# time_vol_dat %>%
#   select(everything())%>%
#   summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.))))

*ANALYTICAL NOTE: These two questions are paired. Have to think about how to handle the fact that though the net change seems to be positive after volunteering with CCFRP, we may lose some of the fine scale movements of anglers actually having negative opinions after volunteering with CCFRP.

### ANALYSES



## Region

* South = SIO and UCSB

* Central = CP and MLML

* North = BML and HSU

Potential hypotheses here include that angler feelings toward MPAs and conservation may be different by region. However, big caveat is that there are likely more volunteers from the central region that have fished with CCFRP for a longer period of time. Time volunteered will covary with region. See above for time volunteered visual and analytic work. 

### VISUALS

Breaking up some of the questions regarding feelings towards MPAs and conservaion mindedness based on the region that anglers indicated as their primary interaction with CCFRP.
